The parameters used here are limited, but can be increased.
To encrypt "m", we calculate 65.
2790 = c - 3(26)
The square-and-multiply algorithm can be used to quickly calculate modular exponentiation.
RSA implementations usually add random padding to the value "m" before encryption to prevent security issues.
Padding is used to make sure that a message is encrypted to a secure ciphertext and that it will not fall into the range of insecure plaintexts.
RSA encryption is used to securely pad messages according to standards such as PKCS#1.
The size of the original message must be smaller than the padded message.
RSA padding must be designed to prevent attacks that exploit predictable message structures.
RSA padding must be designed to prevent attacks that exploit predictable message structures.
RSA encryption was made semantically secure with the PKCS#1 standard up to version 1.5.
OAEP prevents attacks on encryption by using Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding.
PKCS#1 includes RSA-PSS, a probabilistic signature scheme for RSA, to provide extra security for RSA signatures.
Alice sends Bob an encrypted message using his public key.
Alice can send Bob an encrypted message using his public key, but Bob cannot verify that the message is from Alice.
RSA can be used to sign a message to verify its origin.
Alice wants to send a signed message to Bob.
Alice signs a message by creating a hash value, raising it to the power of "d" (modulo "n"), and attaching it to the message.
He raises the signature to the power of "e" (modulo "n"), then compares the hash value with the message's actual hash value.
If Bob and Alice agree on the message, Bob knows that Alice's private key was used and the message has not been altered.
RSA-PSS is essential for both message signing and encryption.
Bob wants to send information to Alice.
RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission.
The prime numbers must be kept confidential.
RSA algorithm keys are generated with a modulus "n" and a public (or encryption) exponent "e" for the public key.
The "private key" is the secret decryption exponent "d".

Rocket motors using black powder are made in small sizes to reduce the risk of explosion and improve efficiency.
Model rocket motors come in sizes 1/8 A to F and use black powder or ammonium perchlorate composite propellant.
Black powder is the oldest type of propellant.
Rockets used gunpowder before guns did.
Black powder is made of charcoal, sulfur, and saltpeter (potassium nitrate).
By 1045, the Chinese had developed black powder, as evidenced by The Wu-ching Tsung-Yao (Complete Compendium of Military Classics).
The Chinese used black powder to create weapons in the 13th century.
Rockets were first used as weapons in 1232.
The Chinese used a catapult launcher to fire "arrows of fire".

The Daleks are a fictional alien race featured in the British TV show "Doctor Who".
Daleks are often mistaken for robots, but they are actually living creatures inside a mechanical shell.
The episode "Genesis of the Daleks" changed the way the Daleks were portrayed, with most of their past history being forgotten.
The Daleks were originally operated by the operator pushing them with their feet on nylon castors.
The prop was so heavy that it had to be pushed up ramps by stagehands.
The Dalek's movements were sometimes jerky due to the difficulty of controlling all its parts at once.
The "new series" version of the Dalek has a remotely controlled dome and eyestalk, which eliminates the need for the operator to manually control the Dalek's movement and arms.
The Daleks were created after a nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races 500 years ago.
Davros, a Kaled scientist, created the Daleks in 1975 in the episode "Genesis of the Daleks".
The Kaled-Thal war was a thousand-year-long conflict fought with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, resulting in mutations among the Kaled race.
Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to create a mutated form of the species, and placed them in tanks based on his own life-support chair.
The Daleks have a Parliament and many different designs from the original and new series in "Asylum of the Daleks" (2012).
Davros created a new race using his own cells.
Davros and the Daleks returned in the 2008 season finale of Doctor Who, "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End".
Davros and the Daleks plan to use a "reality bomb" to destroy reality, and they need stolen planets to do it.
The Daleks were created by Terry Nation and designed by Raymond Cusick.
The Daleks were introduced in the second "Doctor Who" serial in December 1963.
The "Carry On" films were a huge success, spawning many sequels and two films in the 1960s.
The word "Dalek" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as a type of robot from the BBC Television science-fiction programme "Dr. Who".
A Dalek was featured on a British postage stamp in 1999.
In 2005, a single Dalek appeared in the BBC One episode "Dalek".

The Tenth Doctor caused a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London to be resolved by sucking both groups back into the Void.
The Cult used an "emergency temporal shift" to escape destruction.
Four Daleks, Sec, Jast, Thay and Caan, were stranded in 1930s New York and attempted to rebuild the Dalek race in the Empire State Building.

Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed when the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is at least 20 mm Hg (3300 Pa) at rest, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is diagnosed when the mean PAP is ≥ 20 mm Hg, pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (PAOP) is ≤ 15 mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is > 3 Wood Units.

The blood may contain less oxygen than usual.
The left side of the heart has difficulty pumping enough oxygen to the body, especially during physical activity.
Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed through a series of tests to distinguish between five major types: pulmonary arterial hypertension, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, and multifactorial.
PAH is diagnosed after ruling out other causes of pulmonary hypertension.
In 1973, the World Health Organization classified pulmonary hypertension into two categories: primary (caused by a disease of the pulmonary arteries) and secondary (caused by other, non-vascular factors).
